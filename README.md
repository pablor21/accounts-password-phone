Accounts Password Phone
=========================

Accounts-Password-Phone is a Meteor package that let you authenticate by phone number.
The package use SMS code verification to verify the user account.
The package is a remake of okland:accounts-phone, some methods have been rewritten to make it compatible with meteor 1.8

## Installation

In a Meteor app directory, enter:

```
$ meteor add pablor21:accounts-password-phone
```


## Examples

Let's say you want to register new user and verify him using his phone number

Verify phone number - Create user if not exists

```js
var userPhone = '+972545999999';
// Request for sms phone verification -- please note before receiving SMS you should Follow the SMS Integration tutorial below
Accounts.requestPhoneVerification(userPhone, function(){});
//Debug:  Verify the user phone isn't confirmed it.
console.log('Phone verification status is :', Accounts.isPhoneVerified());

// After receiving SMS let user enter his code and verify account by sending it to the server
var verificationCode = 'CodeRecivedBySMS';

Accounts.verifyPhone(userPhone, verificationCode, function(){});
//Debug:  Verify the user phone is confirmed.
console.log('Phone verification status is :', Accounts.isPhoneVerified());
```

## SMS Integration

```js
 SMS.send = function (options) {};
```
  Where the parameter options is an object containing :
      * @param options
      * @param options.from {String} - The sending SMS number
      * @param options.to {String} - The receiver SMS number
      * @param options.body {String}  - The content of the SMS

Moreover to control the Sending number and the message content you can override the phone Template

```js
  SMS.phoneTemplates = {
    from: '+9729999999',
    siteName: 'mysupersite.com'
    resetPassword: {
        text: (user, code)=>{
        	return 'Your code is: ' + code;
        }
    },
    verifyPhone: {
       text: (user, code)=>{
        	return 'Your code is: ' + code;
        }
    },
  };
```

* Note: it can only be done on server


## Simple API
```js

 /**
  * @summary Request a new verification code. create user if not exist
  * @locus Client
  * @param {String} phone -  The phone we send the verification code to.
  * @param {Function} [callback] Optional callback. Called with no arguments on success, or with a single `Error` argument on failure.
  */
 Accounts.requestPhoneVerification = function (phone, callback)  {  };

 /**
  * @summary Marks the user's phone as verified. Optional change passwords, Logs the user in afterwards..
  * @locus Client
  * @param {String} phone - The phone number we want to verify.
  * @param {String} code - The code retrieved in the SMS.
  * @param {Function} [callback] Optional callback. Called with no arguments on success, or with a single `Error` argument on failure.
  */
 Accounts.verifyPhone = function (phone, code, callback) {...};


 /**
  * Returns whether the current user phone is verified
  * @returns {boolean} Whether the user phone is verified
  */
 Accounts.isPhoneVerified = function () {  };

```

## Settings - you can control

 - verificationCodeLength    : The length of the verification code
 - verificationMaxRetries    : The number of SMS verification tries before verification temporary lock
 - verificationRetriesWaitTime : The verification lock time after max retries
 - verificationWaitTime      : The verification lock time if between two retries
 - sendPhoneVerificationCodeOnCreation  : Whether to send phone number verification on user creation
 - forbidClientAccountCreation: Don't let client create user on server
 - phoneVerificationMasterCode: Optional master code if exists let user verify account by entering this code  for example  '1234'
 - adminPhoneNumbers: Optional array of admin phone numbers - don't need to be valid phone numbers for example  ['+972123456789', '+972987654321']


 In order to change those settings just override the property under :

 Accounts._options

 For example to change the verificationMaxRetries to 3 all we need to do is:
```js
Accounts._options.verificationMaxRetries = 3;
```


## More code samples


Creating new user
```js
  // Create a user.

  var options = {phone:'+972545999999'};
  // You can also create user with password
  options.password = 'VeryHardPassword';


  Accounts.createUserWithPhone(options, function (){});
  // Debug: Verify the user phone isn't confirmed it.
  console.log('Phone verification status is :', Accounts.isPhoneVerified());
```

```js
 var userPhone = '+972545999999';
 // Request for sms phone verification -- please note before receiving SMS you should Follow the SMS Integration tutorial below
 Accounts.requestPhoneVerification(userPhone, function(){});
 //Debug:  Verify the user phone isn't confirmed it.
 console.log('Phone verification status is :', Accounts.isPhoneVerified());

 // After receiving SMS let user enter his code and verify account by sending it to the server
 var verificationCode = 'CodeRecivedBySMS';
 var newPassword = null;
 // You can keep your old password by sending null in the password field
 Accounts.verifyPhone(userPhone, verificationCode, function(){});
 //Debug:  Verify the user phone is confirmed.
 console.log('Phone verification status is :', Accounts.isPhoneVerified());
```

Login existing user - Requires creating user with password


```js

 var userPhone = '+972545999999';
 var password = 'VerySecure';
 var callback = function() {};
 Accounts.createUserWithPhone({phone:userPhone, password:password}, function (){});

 Meteor.loginWithPhoneAndPassword({phone:userPhone}, password, callback);
```
